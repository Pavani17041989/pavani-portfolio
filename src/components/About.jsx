          I’m a Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js and ReactJS.
          I’m passionate about using these skills to develop innovative
          web applications that are user-friendly. I’m always eager to learn
          more about web development and marketing. I enjoy the challenge of
          coding and solving real-world problems. Currently, I’m looking for
          opportunities to join a team that values innovation and shares my
          enthusiasm for technology.
